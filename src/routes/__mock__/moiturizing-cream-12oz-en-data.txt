My dermatologist recommended this stuff, specifically the cream, not the lotion, and it is life changing. (The lotion has more water which will evaporate and leave skin drier than cream) I cant wait to see how it works through the winter. My hands were cracking, bleeding, and weeping last winter from the dry air. I am confident this stuff will help me prevent that continuing, and help my skin recover quicker when it does get too dry. Dreading the harsh New England weather a bit less now."

This cream has all but reduced itching from tight dry skin. I started the cream after I endured a terrible skin affliction. This was recommended by a nurse to help restore my skin and it sure worked. I now use the face hydration cleanser which I really like as well. I recommend this to everyone!"

            "review": "This lotion is the best at keeping both my face and body from getting overly dry in the winter or too oily on those warm, summer days. What I like most about Cerave is that it has no unnecessary colored dyes and is perfume free so that it does not fight with whatever cologne I put on that day. I use it when I am fresh out of the shower to lock in the water still on my face & skin and it always goes on smooth. I purchased several containers for a friend of mine as a casual gift and now she uses and swears by it, too."
