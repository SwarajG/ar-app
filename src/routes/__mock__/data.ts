      review: 'If I could come up with a dream cleanser on my own, this one would be it. For someone who has dry skin, this cleanser is a LIFE SAVER. My skin never feels dry or stripped after using this, which is amazing. It makes my skin so soft, smooth, and glowy. It also does a pretty great job of taking off any products left on throughout the day. I use it morning and night! And the price point is incredible too! Ticking off all my boxes with this cleanser! THANK YOU CERAVE!',

      review: 'This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and in just a couple of weeks cleared all of my acne. I am lucky to have nice skin to begin with but as an athlete, I got acne from sweat in certain areas like between my brows, on my chin and nose and this cleanser cleared it within a couple of weeks. My sensitive skin is clear and I rarely find a pimple on my face anymore since I began using this.',

      review: 'I am 68 and have worked in a high-end Spa with extremely expensive skin care products. My local drugstore expert told me about CeraVe saying it used to be prescription only - she highly recommended it. When I saw the words Hyaluronic Acid I knew right away that was good as that is what attracts and binds moisture. Also the fragrance free product was a big plus for me. Although I have very good skin I had a few dry scaly patches near my eyes and mouth that no matter what I used would always resurface. Not any more! This product is gentle and creamy and doesn’t leave my skin feeling either dry or greasy. Worth every penny! Highly recommend!',
